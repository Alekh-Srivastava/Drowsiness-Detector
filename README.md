# Drowsiness-Detector
 Drowsiness-Detector is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.
Which predicts the current status of your face among three cases:
1-Sleeepy
2-Drowsy
3-Awake

Logic:
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
